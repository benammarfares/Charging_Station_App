<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![Capture2](https://github.com/benammarfares/Charging_Station_App/assets/99650831/07c6dd1b-c576-4431-9eff-ea8c70503374)
<br>
* This project currently has only one branch, which was created and made in 2023 on the University Branch. I have decided to make it public for anyone who wants to add to or upgrade the work. For any other information about it, please feel 
  free to contact me.

  * As I mentioned, this is a desktop application project that also has a prototype of a solar panel, RFID, and LCD authentication using an Arduino Uno board. However, the project can work without the Arduino configuration if needed.

  * Like any desktop application, there are admin, staff, and client user roles. Each user has their own login and interface to manage the system. Clients can add their car details (model, date, battery level, battery capacity, etc.) so they       can charge their electric cars at the station.

  * The car information is related to a session table, where the car will be charged with electricity. That table will primarily track the session capacity to charge cars at the station.

  * Additionally, each client will have a profile interface to easily manipulate their account without having to come to the station every time they want to change something.

  * The system also includes maintenance of the charging sessions, so that when a session is empty, it can be recharged.

  * In the prototype, I have included a solar panel that tracks any available light and generates voltage based on the light levels. This voltage is used to charge the sessions, with the solar panel working in the morning and at night when it 
    is loaded.

  * Furthermore, I have implemented a client authentication system using a card and RFID, so each client can use their card to identify themselves and then charge their car. While the client is charging, they can see the real-time charging 
    process percentage displayed on an LCD. Once the car is fully charged, a buzzer will sound as an alarm, and a motor will lift the stop panel next to the car.

### Built With

For database We used Oracle sql developer :<br>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó Important !!! <br>
 *After cloning you must change the export.sql , don't worry it's a simple modification. (Just change FARES1 with your ODBC Client Username, this Username also should be the one for your DB ,for more informations watch the video i linked it covers all the configuration parts üòâ)
The most important thing is that you should create the db in Oracle Sqldeveloper (also in the video üòÖ).
And for the database config just open connexion.cpp for any modification based on your requirements.
 

### Prerequisites

Follow the youtube Video to establish the Oracle Connexion with Qt.

* [Youtube Video How to setup Oracle Conection Qt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E81Z5hCMCYg&t=1201s)

     *[Oracle 11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Vful6RhPNxS-lWOpdJFL1ozW5DmJmEC/view?usp=drive_link)<br>
     *[Sql developer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1inQFrlNt02O20WLUKkXcipZpEiOygubH/view?usp=drive_link)<br>

     *[Instant Client basic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xw_kS7YtXPdF6kPMcE337L_jNwAwYFlb/view?usp=drive_link)<br>


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/benammarfares/Charging_Station_App.git
   ```
2. Install Oracle environment & watch the youtube video for more instructions about configurations.
